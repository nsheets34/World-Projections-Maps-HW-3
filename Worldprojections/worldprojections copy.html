    <title>Projections - Nick Sheets</title>
</head> 
<body> <p> These projections were created in QGIS using a basemap that contained a world cultural vector. Using
    add-ons in QGIS of "Globe Builder" and "Indicatrix Mapper", I was able to pull up different projections to use for the 
map and then add on indicatrices to the map to display the degree of distortion at different points on the map. </p>
    
    
    <h1>WGS84 Projection</h1>
    <h2>This WGS84 projection displays a full world map in a flat, rectnagular projection. This projection has
        a tissot indicatrix on top of the map to display the distortions. It is clear that this projection is more
        heavily distorted towards the north and south ends of the map.</h2>

    <h1>Aitoff Projection</h1>
    <h2>This Aitoff projection gives a more spherical shape to the world map that allows us to see greater
        distortions throughout, but particularly near the far east and west sides, as well as the north and south.
    This projection allows us to see the map in a rounder shape, which is how our earth actually exists. </h2>

    <h1>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h1>
    <h2>This Pseudo Mercator projection gives a farther out view of the world map in a flat 
        form. The distortions are greater at the north and south ends of the map, but the countries 
        seem to be less distorted. However, antartica is particularly distorted in this type of projection. </h2>

    <h1>Winkel Projection</h1>
    <h2>This Winkel projection is supported in a spherical shape. This has a more equal distortion, but 
        is consistent along the equator and while it distorts countries more along the edge of the projection, it
        minimizes the distortion for many of the country's shapes and sizes. </h2>

    <h1>World Cylindrical Projection</h1>
    <h2>In this world cylindrical projection, the shape is put into a cylindrical form 
        on the map. This type of projection allows for high levels of distortion in the northern and southern
        ends of the map, particularly with shape. However, the middle area of the map is very consistent and minimizes
        shape and size distortion in the half of the map directly above and below the equator.</h2>

    <h1>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h1>
    <h2>In this world equidistant conic projection, the map is displayed in a conic shape, which
        views from the northern end of the globe. This projection minimizes the distance distortion across the map 
        and allows for greater distortion on the bottom end of the map towards the south.</h2>

    <h1>North Pole Azimuthal Projection</h1>
    <h2>In this North Pole Azimuthal Projection, there is a conic shape on the map that gives a view from the northern
        part of the map. While this map does distort projection in terms of direction, it minimizes the distortion of
        the northern parts of the map, particularly on the North Pole.</h2>

    <h1>North America Conic Projection</h1>
    <h2>In this North American Conic projection, there is a conic shape that is focused on North America
        and has a straight edge that completes the opposing side of the map. This map minimizes the distortions 
        in North America in shape and size, however is highly distorts all other parts of the map, particularly
        in shape and direction on the opposing side, looking at Asia and Europe.</h2>

    <h1>World Robinson Projection</h1>
    <h2>In this World Robinson projection, there is a consistent amount of distortion throughout the map 
        in comparison to many other projections. The map is projected onto a spherical shape to display the world
        in its round form. The Robinson map minimizes distortions in direction and size, but still has distortions around
        the sperical edges of the map and near the North and South Poles.</h2>
